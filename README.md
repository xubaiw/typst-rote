# Typst Rote

This package includes utility functions for creating rote learning materials in typst.

These functions utilize the `terms` and `underline` elements to create cloze test and mnemonic test.

See `example.typ` for basic usage.

## Installation

This package is not mature enough to be published to Typst Universe. You can use the [utpm](https://github.com/Thumuss/utpm) package manager to make a local clone.

## Roadmap

- [x] `#cloze(content)`
- [x] `#mnemonic(content)`
- [ ] link between different parts
